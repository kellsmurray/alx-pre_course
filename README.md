My first readme

Repo-session
created a new directory called 0x01-git

Starting to code today, so cool
created 3 new directories
created files inside the directories with some data in them

My personal work
created a branch called update_script
updated some files in the branch

Hot fix
made some edits on the main branch of the repository
